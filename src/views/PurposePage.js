            It's time to break the barriers of traditional ecommerce.  
            A purchase is no longer just a transaction, it's an opportunity 
            for people to connect and share.  Collective Commerceâ„¢ turns every 
            purchase into an experience buyers enjoy together on your brand.

            People are looking for ways to connect their passions with others.  
            When they love it, they'll tell their friends.  When they're

            With FEVO, every purchase is a chance to turn one 
            person into a tribe -- and that purchase into a movement.
