Purchases
</h3>
<h4>
PAYMENT.
</h4>
<p>
Certain of our Services allow you to make purchases through the Services (“Purchases”). In order to make a Purchase, you must use a valid credit card or other payment method accepted by the Services (which may change from time to time in our sole discretion) (your “Payment Method”), with full authority to use it. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity and/or eligibility to process your order. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of making Purchases are deemed part of these Terms of Service. We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to allow you to pay for Purchases. The processing of payments will be subject to any applicable terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms of Service. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to make a Purchase, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for such Purchase in accordance with your Payment Method and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your Payment Method. Such charges for your Purchase may include shipping fees and state and local sales tax, the amount of which varies due to factors including the type of item purchased and the shipping destination. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. The sale or purchase of tickets to entertainment events may be regulated by certain state, county and city laws or regulations. You acknowledge that complying with laws is your responsibility, and YOU AGREE NOT TO HOLD US LIABLE FOR YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY LAW OR OUR FAILURE TO NOTIFY YOU OF, OR PROPERLY APPLY, ANY LAW. WE WILL COMPLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MAY PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US TO ASSIST IN ANY INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION THEY MAY CONDUCT. All Purchases of tickets through the Services are final, unless the Event is canceled or the Event provider authorizes a refund through the Services in its sole discretion. You acknowledge that the decision to authorize a refund to you is at the applicable Event provider’s (and not our) sole discretion, and we are not liable for any decision to authorize or not authorize a refund. If the Event provider authorizes refunds to a ticket buyer, we will refund the ticket face value to ticket buyers who request refunds; provided, however, that we are entitled to keep the processing fees charged by us to ticket buyers for such ticket sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree and acknowledge that our obligation to make any refunds is subject and limited to the Event provider’s authorization to issue such refund, as well as our holding or receiving from Event providers of the applicable ticket sale proceeds. If the Event provider does not authorize such refund or we do not have or receive from the Event providers the applicable ticket sale proceeds, then we cannot provide you a refund for such ticket sale.
</p>
<h4>
PAYMENT METHOD.
</h4>
<p>
The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by the applicable terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor, as well as agreements between you and the applicable financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due for your Purchase upon demand.
</p>
<h4>
CURRENT INFORMATION REQUIRED.
</h4>
<p>
YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR PAYMENT METHOD CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR PASSWORD. IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD INFORMATION IS NOT CURRENT, COMPLETE, OR ACCURATE, WE AND/OR THE APPLICABLE PAYMENT PROCESSOR MAY BE UNABLE TO PROCESS YOUR PAYMENT AND WE WILL ACCORDINGLY BE UNABLE TO FULFILL YOUR PURCHASE.
</p>

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever barred.
</p><p>
The arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by you or us and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that you or we have sought public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration after the party seeking public injunctive relief has first prevailed in arbitration. You and we agree that the litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
</p><p>
